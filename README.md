# odin-recipes

This small website project is designed to practice what I've been learning with The Odin Project.

In this project I will create a basic recipe website using HTML. 

In the future I will return to this project to style it with CSS.

The goal is to feel more confident in using HTML to create the foundation of a functional website.
