        <h2>Banana bread recipe</h2>
        <p>This Banana bread is delicious; you can't beat it with a nice cup of tea or coffee.</p>
        <p>Our bananas are grown locally by a lady called Pam who works hard and delivers them to us 
            weekly so we try not to waste any. If they are over-ripe, this is the best time to make 
            some banana bread!</p>
           
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>3-4 over-ripe bananas</li>
