                <li>1 &frac12; cups all purpose flour</li>
                <li>&frac12; tsp vanilla extract</li>
                <li>&frac12; tsp baking powder</li>
                <li>2 drops pink gel food colouring</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <h3>Buttercream</h3>
                <li>1 cup unsalted butter</li>
                <li>3 cups powdered sugar</li>
                <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
                <li>3 tbsp heavy cream</li>
            </ul>

                <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><h3>Mix the flour</h3>
                        <p>Combine the powdered sugar, almond flour and &frac12; teaspoon of salt. mix in food processor on 
                        low speed until powder is extra fine then sift the mixture into a large bowl.</p></li>
                    <li><h3>Beat the mixture</h3>
                        <p>In another large bowl beat the egg whites and &frac12; teaspoon of salt with an electric hand 
                            mixer until peaks begin to form. Gradually add the sugar and continue to beat until the peaks 
                            become stiff. Add the vanilla extract and food colouring and beat until just combined</p> </li>
                    <li><h3>Fold the mixture</h3>
                        <p>Add &frac13; of the sifted flour mixture and fold in until combined, then add the next &frac13; and fold 
                            in and then the final &frac13;. Fold the mixture slowly until it falls from the spatula in ribbons. If 
                            you have time then leave the mixture overnight for the best texture results. If not then go onto the next 
                            step when you are ready.</p></li>
                    <li><h3>Pipe the mixture</h3>
                        <p>Transfer the mixture into a piping bag with a round tip. Pipe 1 &frac12; circles spacing 1 inch apart on a 
                            parchment lined baking sheet. Tap the baking sheet to release any bubbles and let stand for 30 minutes to 
                            1 hour until dry to the touch</p></li>
                     <li><h3>Bake</h3>
                        <p>After preheating the oven to 150Â°C, bake for 17 minutes until the lower part is well risen and the macarons 
                            don't stick to the parchment paper then cool on a wire rack before filling.</p></li>
                     <li><h3>Make the buttercream</h3>
                        <p>In a large bowl, beat the butter with a mixer until light and fluffy then sift in the powdered sugar 
                            and beat until fully combined. Add the vanilla and beat to combine then add the cream 1 tbsp at a 
                            time and beat to combine until the desired consistency is achieved.</p></li>
                    <li><h3>Pipe the buttercream</h3>
                         <p>Transfer the buttercream to a piping bag with a round tip and add a squirt of buttercream to one 
                            macaroon side. Close this with another macaron to create a little sandwich. Repeat with the rest 
                            of the macarons and buttercream.</p></li>

                            of the macarons and buttercream.</p></li>
                    <li><h3>Let them bloom</h3>
                         <p>Put the macarons in a sealed container and into the fridge for at least 2 hours but ideally
